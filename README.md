# hangMan
I programmed a hangman game using Python 3. Summer 2020.
I used f1 drivers and movies as example files for words, but you can use any .txt file you want. 
The extra.py file contains the extra visuals. The hangmantools.py is all my functions for the game. The game.py file is where the game is run.
